<p>Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile and difficult to make bit coin price prediction, but that doesn’t stop people from trying. Here are some expert opinions on what the BTC price might be in 2030.
</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s price has been on a rollercoaster ride over the past few years, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down. After hitting an all-time high of over $19,000 in December 2017, the price of BTC plummeted to around $3,000 just a year later.
</p>
<p>Since then, the price has recovered somewhat and is currently hovering around the $10,000 mark. But can we make bit coin price prediction 2030?
</p>
<p>Some experts believe that the price of Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million by 2030. This might seem like a stretch, but if you consider the fact that the total supply of BTC is capped at 21 million, and the increasing demand for the cryptocurrency, it’s not impossible.
</p>
<p>Other experts are more conservative in their predictions, and believe that the price of BTC will be more around the $100,000 mark by 2030. This is still a significant bit coin prediction and increase from the current price, and would mean that Bitcoin would be firmly established as a mainstream currency.
</p>
<p>No one can really know for sure where the price of Bitcoin will be in 2030 as bit coin price changing so fast but one thing is for sure – it’s going to be an exciting ride.
